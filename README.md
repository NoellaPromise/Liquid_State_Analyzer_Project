# Project Overview

This is a  learning project that creates a liquid state analyzer web application. It shows different states 
liquids take according to temperature and Atmospheric pressure.

**STILL** üíß: Normal liquid state

**FROZEN** ‚ùÑÔ∏è: Solid state with ice crystals

**BOILING** üí®: Gas state with bubbles and steam

Students will learn backend programming by filling in missing Python code!

## Getting Started

### Step 1 : Download and Install VS Code
- Download from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install normally
- Install essential Python extensions
- Set up code formatting and error detection

### Step 2 : Install Python (if not already installed)
- Go to [Python](python.org)
- Click "Download Python" (get version 3.8 or newer)
- **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Install normally

### Step 3 : Clone the project from GitHub
1. Open Terminal/command prompt
  - Press Win + R, type cmd, press Enter

2. Navigate to where you want the project:
    `cd Desktop`

3. Clone the repository:`git  clone https://github.com/NoellaPromise/Liquid_State_Analyzer_Project.git`
  
4. Enter the project folder:
    `cd LIQUID_STATE_ANALYZER_PROJECT`

### Step 4 : Test your Setup

**Open Command Prompt/Terminal in your project folder**
  - Run : `python liquid_analyzer.py`  ***This will have errors because you need to fill in the blanks!***



## What Students Need to Fill In
1. **Liquid Data Dictionary**
Complete the `get_default_liquids()` function with liquid properties.

2. **Pressure Calculation**
Fill in the formula to calculate how pressure affects boiling point.

3. **State Logic**
Complete the if/elif/else statements to determine if liquid is solid, liquid, or gas.

4. **File Operations**
Complete the code to save and load results from JSON files.

5. **User Input**
Fill in code to get temperature input from user.

6. **Display Results**
Complete the print statements to show liquid information.


## Assessment Checklist
**Students should be able to:**

 - [ ] Explain what dictionaries are and how to use them
 - [ ] Write if/elif/else statements for decision making
 - [ ] Handle user input with error checking
 - [ ] Save and load data from JSON files
 - [ ] Debug common Python errors
 - [ ] Explain how the flask container shows different states
